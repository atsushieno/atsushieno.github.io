title: Instant music CD release experience for an indie music festival
---
I had been quiet after attending to Audio Developer Conference (in English). I had been enjoying Europe after 10+ years of absence there. Then I changed something in life... I had been busy to become a songwriter.

## WTH how come did you become a composer?

It is surprising maybe to those who know me somewhat well. When I attended to ADC2018, I talked to some random people and then I shot question around, like "do you compose music?" And the answers were _mostly_ "yes".

I felt incompetent. They were mostly songwriters and they were mostly developers at the same time. I wasn't. I have been developing MML (music macro language) compiler which is all about songwriting in text, but I didn't produce music with it... at least, a lot. I did some, but it was like in 199x and then I only "ported" some old compositions to my own language. That was kind of dogfooding, but I should have done more of those. I wasn't indeed much confident with my own principles "I can compose songs with my own toolchains".

I thought that I should begin something. The first thing I tried was to attend to something like [M3](http://www.m3net.jp/), one of the biggest indie music festival which inherits in-house Comic-Market-like culture, with 10,000 visitors and 1000-ish exhibitors. I had some experience with that kind of "festival", so I thought it would be good for me. It was in late November and the next M3 was too far away. I wanted to begin with "easier" one for entry level composer.

That's how I found http://gensouongaku.info/fes/ - it was a festival specific to "Fantasy" kind of music. It comes with "you define what 'fantasy' means" statement. It practically meant something like soundtracks (like "the Lord of the Rings"), VGMs (Final Fantasy series), even storytelling (in Japangrish we call them "voice drama CDs"), can be literally anything...

That was kind of familiar to me. I applied for it with little-to-no thoughts. After a few weeks, the organizers stated that they expanded the space and all the applicants were accepted. There were about 90 exhibitor groups in the end, including mine.

I was under pressure. I hadn't really compose anything for like 15+ years. And now I have to compose something only by myself. I used to write some songs with a MIDI device (Roland SC-8820) when I was a student, but that was ages ago. I thought I could dump and run away... (then the organizers will mark me as "should be dropped for future festivals")

Fortunately I had certain amount of time. I could spend all my time for learning how to compose songs using modern software, as well as composition basics. It was post-ADC time and I had a lot of interest in the new technology, but I decided to concentrate on songwriting. To dive into this kind of software industry, I have to learn those technologies anyways.


## OK that's enough, let me see what you made

These are the trailers on soundcloud and youtube. They are my first video and song uploads...!
