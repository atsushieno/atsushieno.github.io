title: Instant music CD release experience for an indie music festival
---
I had been quiet after attending to Audio Developer Conference (in English). I had been enjoying Europe after 10+ years of absence there. Then I changed something in life... I had been busy to become a songwriter.

It is surprising maybe. When I attended to ADC2018, I talked to some random people and then I shot question around, like "do you compose music?" And the answers were _mostly_ "yes".

I felt incompete. They were mostly songwriters and they were mostly developers at the same time. I wasn't. I have been developing MML (music macro language) compiler which is all about songwriting in text, but I didn't produce music with it - a lot. I did some. But it was like in 199x and then I only "ported" some old compositions to my own language. That was kind of dogfooding, but I should have done more of those. I wasn't indeed much confident with my own principles "I can compose songs with my own toolchains".



## Let me see what you made
